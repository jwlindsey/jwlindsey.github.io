        Failure is an option. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough. People tend to be scared of failure but I'd argue that without failure there is no opportunity to do extrordinary things. I was your ordinary nerd, built my first computer out of scrap ATM parts when I was 7 years old. From there my father ordered my first copy of Mandrake Linux. We installed it together and from that point on I became a distro junky.

        I grew up working on my grandparent's farm in the summertime which made me no stranger to hard work and determination. My career has taken me everywhere from repairing circuit boards and building battery packs to wiring grand multi-million dollar houses for A-listers. I worked concerts as a sound and/or lighting technician for years and have even managed several retail stores. You never know where life will take you if you aren't afraid to fall on your face a few times. The important part is getting back up.

        For the past several months I have been learning to code. I attended an awesome coding bootcamp called firehose that taught me a few tools through ruby on rails. However, more importantly they taught me how to teach myself how to code. I have greatly enjoyed my journey so far and am looking forward to seeing where this new career will take me. What new errors will I face? What new puzzles will I solve? What new amazing app will I build? Even, what amazing apps will I be able to support? Who knows but I'm looking forward to the journey.
